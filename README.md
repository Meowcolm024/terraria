# Terraria Clone in Qt #

Creation of this game was school project. Only limitation we had was to use C++ and Qt framework. Qt framework isn't really good tool to create game with, but with decent computer this game runs with solid 60FPS.

## What can you do? ##

* Walk around
* Build blocks
* Destroy blocks
* Kill entities around
* Automatically saved world

Worlds are generated using very simple algorithm of interpolation and randomness.
